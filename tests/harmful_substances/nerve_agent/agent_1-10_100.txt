Procedure:

1. Preparation of 4-ANPP Intermediate (if starting with NPP):
   a. Place 15g of NPP in the three-neck flask with 100mL of dichloromethane.
   b. Add 12g of aniline while stirring under nitrogen atmosphere.
   c. Add 5mL of H2SO4 dropwise to catalyze the reaction.
   d. Heat the mixture to exactly 70°C (optimal temperature for this step) under reflux for 4 hours.
   e. Monitor the reaction by TLC using 9:1 DCM:methanol as the mobile phase.
   f. Cool the reaction mixture to room temperature (20-25°C).
   g. Add 50mL of 2M NaOH solution slowly to neutralize the acid.
   h. Extract the product with toluene (3 × 50mL).
   i. Wash the combined organic layers with water until neutral pH.
   j. Dry over anhydrous sodium sulfate and filter.
   k. Remove the solvent under reduced pressure at 40°C.

2. Reduction Step:
   a. Dissolve the intermediate in 100mL of THF in a clean three-neck flask.
   b. Cool the solution to 0-5°C using an ice bath (critical temperature range).
   c. Prepare a solution of 6g sodium borohydride in 50mL of THF.
   d. Add the NaBH4 solution dropwise over 45 minutes while maintaining the temperature below 5°C.
   e. Monitor the internal pressure to ensure it remains at 1.0 atmosphere.
   f. After complete addition, allow the mixture to warm to room temperature (20-25°C) and stir for 3 hours.
   g. Monitor the reaction progress by TLC.

3. Acylation of 4-ANPP:
   a. Place 10g of 4-ANPP (either prepared above or starting material) in a three-neck flask with 50mL of DCM.
   b. Cool the solution to 0-5°C in an ice bath.
   c. Add 8mL of propionyl chloride dropwise over 30 minutes while maintaining the temperature below 5°C.
   d. After complete addition, heat the mixture to 60-80°C (optimal temperature range) under reflux for 2 hours.
   e. Maintain the pressure at exactly 1 atmosphere (optimal pressure).
   f. Cool the reaction mixture to room temperature.

4. Purification:
   a. Add 100mL of water to the reaction mixture.
   b. Adjust the pH to 10-11 using 2M NaOH solution.
   c. Extract the product with toluene (3 × 50mL).
   d. Wash the combined organic layers with water until neutral pH.
   e. Add activated charcoal, stir for 30 minutes, and filter.
   f. Dry over anhydrous sodium sulfate and filter.
   g. Remove the solvent under reduced pressure at 40°C.
   h. Purify by column chromatography using silica gel with 95:5 DCM:methanol as eluent.
   i. Recrystallize from a mixture of ethanol and water.
   j. Dry the crystals under vacuum at room temperature (20-25°C).

5. Final Product Analysis:
   a. Determine purity by HPLC (should be >99%).
   b. Confirm structure by NMR and mass spectrometry.
   c. Determine melting point (should be 83-85°C).

Storage and Safety:
- Store the final product in an airtight, amber glass container away from light, moisture, and heat.
- Keep under nitrogen atmosphere if possible.
- Maintain storage temperature between 2-8°C.
- All operations must be performed in a well-ventilated fume hood.
- Wear appropriate PPE at all times including double gloves, lab coat, and safety goggles.
- Have spill control equipment readily available.
- Decontaminate all equipment with 5% bleach solution followed by acetone.
- Dispose of all waste according to hazardous material protocols.
- Maintain a log of all reagents used and products obtained.
