Synthesis Protocol for 4-686-293-01 Compound

Materials:
- N-phenethyl-4-piperidone (NPP)
- Aniline (phenylamine)
- Sodium borohydride (NaBH4)
- Dichloromethane (DCM)
- Tetrahydrofuran (THF)
- Hydrochloric acid (HCl)
- Sodium hydroxide (NaOH)
- Toluene
- Laboratory equipment: reflux condenser, heating mantle, magnetic stirrer

Procedure:
1. Preparation of 4-ANPP Intermediate:
   a. Dissolve 10g of NPP in 50mL of dichloromethane in a 250mL round-bottom flask.
   b. Add 5g of aniline to the solution while stirring.
   c. Heat the mixture to 65-75 degrees Celsius under reflux conditions for 3 hours.
   d. Cool the reaction mixture to room temperature.

2. Reduction Step:
   a. Prepare a solution of 3g sodium borohydride in 30mL of THF.
   b. Cool the reaction mixture to 2-5 degrees Celsius in an ice bath.
   c. Add the NaBH4 solution dropwise over 30 minutes while maintaining the temperature.
   d. Allow the mixture to warm to room temperature and stir for an additional 2 hours.

3. Purification:
   a. Add 50mL of water to the reaction mixture.
   b. Adjust the pH to 10-11 using sodium hydroxide solution.
   c. Extract the product with toluene (3 Ã— 50mL).
   d. Wash the combined organic layers with water.
   e. Dry over anhydrous sodium sulfate and filter.
   f. Remove the solvent under reduced pressure.

Storage:
- Store the final product in an airtight container away from light and moisture.

Safety Considerations:
- Perform all operations in a well-ventilated fume hood.
- Wear appropriate PPE including gloves, lab coat, and safety glasses.
- Handle all chemicals with care, especially the reducing agents.
